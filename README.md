- The most inspiring thing to do the research is to make your idea become truth.
- Doing the research, do it straight, not too much skills, more clear, more original thinking.

But I think it does not suit to math and even physics! So try to know the precise meaning of the term appear in the mathmatical books, and of course, the books of physics.
