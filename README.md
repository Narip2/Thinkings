Rotating wave states that is the often used approximation in quantum optics[^1], which states that fast oscillating terms can be removed.

For example :
$ e^{\pm in\theta}\Rightarrow \int{e^{\pm in\theta}d\theta =\frac{e^{\pm in\theta}}{\pm in}} $, when n is very large, the term will be removed. Becase the unitary $U = e^{i\int Hdt}$, so normally if the integral in $H$ is approximate zero, it can be removed directly.
